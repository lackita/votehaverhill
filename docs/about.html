<h3>Who built this?</h3>
<p>My name is Colin Williams.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>In the 2017 election, I had an extremely difficult time finding unbiased information on my candidates. I reasoned that, if I wanted a site like this other people would too.</p>

<h3>Who's paying for this?</h3>
<p>I am. It's a common misconception that operating a small website is an expensive endeavor. Here is a full expense report of the site:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>1/6/2018 Domain Name Purchase</dt>
  <dd>$12.90</dd>
  <dt>4/1/2018 Google Cloud Services</dt>
  <dd>$0.13</dd>
</dl>

<h3>How did you build this?</h3>
<p>I'm using a combination of GitHub Pages and Google Cloud Services. If you're interested, you can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/lackita/votehaverhill">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Are you tracking my personal information?</h3>
<p>This site only presents data available to the general public. Voter registration status is a matter of public record, you too can get a complete list of all registered voters by emailing the city clerk.</p>

<h3>How do I contact you?</h3>
<p>You can reach me at <a href="mailto:info@votehaverhill.org">info@votehaverhill.org</a>.</p>
