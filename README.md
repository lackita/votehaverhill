# Vote Haverhill: Getting out to vote in Haverhill

Goal of the project: A compelling site collecting information about
all elections taking place in Haverhill, MA.

Motivation: I had trouble finding much information about the 2017
election, made it difficult to make informed decisions about different
candidates positions.

# TODO

  position on page.
* Schedule of election candidacy process, including marker of where we are in that process
* List of candidates for each position
